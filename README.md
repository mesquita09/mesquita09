- I am passionate about technology and how it can transform society. I have a background in business with specialization in finance, however, I currently dedicate myself to learn programming, most recently javascript and linux â™¥.

- I like to have a continuous learning, always challenging myself and learning interesting things. The desire to evolve feeds me in pursuit of many interests, hobbies, fields of study and enterprises. I am a fast learner, able to acquire new skills and reconcile different projects and functions with relative facility.
